# dpop7

`dpop7` is a *pure-python* open-source library of Distributed POPulation-based OPtimization for large-scale black-box optimization (via [Ray](https://ray.io/)). Currently, it is **actively updated** (from 2023 to 2027).

For distributed systems, orchestration, scheduling, fault tolerance, and auto-scaling are handled automatically by [Ray](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-overview/index.html).
